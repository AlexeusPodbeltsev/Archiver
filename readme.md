As a Mac OS user I faced the problem with the encoding of unzipped file. 
My device uses "UTF-8", but the zipped file was encoded in "cp866". 
Thus, I decided to create my own program which is capable of unzipping files in MacOS in a proper way.
For now my program can help people, who faced with same problem.
However, there still is a room for improvement.
